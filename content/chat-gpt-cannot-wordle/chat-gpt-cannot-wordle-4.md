First, Chat-GPT has an incorrect description of how its algorithm works. It says that `DETER` matches `EERIE` with correct letters in the second and fourth place. In fact, the `E` in the second place is correct and the other `E` is in the wrong place. Plus, the `R` should have been marked as another correct letter in teh wrong place. The correct score would have been `.X.xx`.

Plus, we know the algorithm is wrong because it is still doing only a single pass over the words.
