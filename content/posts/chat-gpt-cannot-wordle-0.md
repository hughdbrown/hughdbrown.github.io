Recently, I had an idea for Chat-GPT. I have some python code for solving Wordle problems but there is a clear bottleneck. There are lots of calls to score a test word against an actual word. It would run a lot faster in a compiled language, not an interpreted language like python. I figured I'd do it in Rust but get a head start with some code generated by Chat-GPT.

But what I did not count on is that Chat-GPT cannot write this code given five chances and the starting python code. [Have a look.](/chat-gpt-cannot-wordle/chat-gpt-cannot-wordle-1)
