I asked Chat-GPT: 
> Create alternative lyrics for "That's Amore". Modify song to be about a moray eel.

And I was hoping for stuff like this:
```
When the jaws open wide
And there's more jaws inside
That's a moray.

When it skulks in the reef
And has two sets of teeth
That's a moray.

When an eel bites your thigh
And you bleed out and die
That's a moray.
```

But Chat GPT just did not get it:
```
When you're swimming in the sea
And you suddenly see
A moray eel
With its sharp, pointy teeth
And its slimy, snakelike wreath
It's a moray eel

With its long, sleek body
And its eyes that look quite odd-y
It's a moray eel
In the coral, it will hide
But if you get too close, it won't abide
It's a moray eel
```
